## Ethics in the workplace

## Face Recognition

### About the article 

#### Following employee protests at Google and Microsoft over government contracts, workers at Amazon are circulating an internal letter to CEO Jeff Bezos, asking him to stop selling the company’s Rekognition facial recognition software to law enforcement and to boot the data-mining firm Palantir from its cloud services.

#### Amazon employees objected to the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy at the U.S. border, which has resulted in thousands of children being separated from their parents.

#### “Along with much of the world we watched in horror recently as U.S. authorities tore children away from their parents,” the letter, distributed on a mailing list called ‘we-won’t-build-it,’ states. “In the face of this immoral U.S. policy, and the U.S.’s increasingly inhumane treatment of refugees and immigrants beyond this specific policy, we are deeply concerned that Amazon is implicated, providing infrastructure and services that enable ICE and DHS.”

## My reflections

#### I can conclude from this article that the Amazon's face tracking program has proven its strength and accuracy, which led to the arrest of illegal immigrants to the United States of America. What increased the employees’ sympathy is watching children being removed from their parents because their parents will be arrested, and this is something that does not bother us as human beings, but we also cannot justify the act of illegal immigrants, I mean what is correct, do you stand with the government that is doing its duty! Or what, I finally think that the program will remain with the police because far from the immigrants, this program can track and monitor criminals and outlaws

## The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars

### About the article

#### Multiple studies estimate that autonomous cars would dramatically reduce road accidents – up to 90 per cent, according to a 2015 report by McKinsey & Company.

#### "The greater challenge is the artificial intelligence behind the machine," Toyota Canada president Larry Hutchinson said, addressing the TalkAuto Conference in Toronto last November. "Think of the millions of situations that we process and decisions that we have to make in real traffic. … We need to program that intelligence into a vehicle, but we don't have the data yet to create a machine that can perceive and respond to the virtually endless permutations of near misses and random occurrences that happen on even a simple trip to the corner store."

#### Consider, he said, the ethical dilemma that an autonomously driven car would need to resolve in an instant when a child jumps suddenly into the car's path from the curb. There's no time to brake. What then? Veer left into oncoming traffic, possibly causing an accident that would injure the driver and passengers? Veer right onto the sidewalk, possibly injuring pedestrians? Continue straight, possibly colliding with the child?


## My reflections

#### For me, I see solutions such as the car hitting the child, so what is the moral solution?!
#### The problem here is the moral dilemma, because morality is relative. You will find someone telling you, for example, make the car hit the old man instead of a child, because the child did not see anything in life and did not enjoy it, but the old man only lived a long life, and another person tells you to tread the child in order to save, for example, a pregnant mother instead of dancing girls and so on, these decisions Ratio according to people's view of morality and what standard of morality they have, but I go with a suggestion I quote from the text 

### “ Germany last year became the first country to attempt to answer such morbid questions with actual guidelines. The proposed rules state that self-driving cars should always attempt to minimize human death and shouldn't discriminate between individuals based on age, gender or any other factor. Human lives should also always be given priority over animals or property ”
