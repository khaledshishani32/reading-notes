### The <color> CSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space.
### A <color> may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.
## A <color> can be defined in any of the following ways:

### Using a keyword (such as blue or transparent)
### Using the RGB cubic-coordinate system (via the #-hexadecimal or the rgb() and rgba() functional notations)
### Using the HSL cylindrical-coordinate system (via the hsl() and hsla() functional notations)

## Color keywords
### Color keywords are case-insensitive identifiers that represent a specific color, such as red, blue, black, or lightseagreen. Although the names more or less describes their respective colors, they are essentially artificial, without a strict rationale behind the names used.

## There are a few caveats to consider when using color keywords:

### HTML only recognizes the 16 basic color keywords found in CSS1, using a specific algorithm to convert unrecognized values (often to completely different colors). The other color keywords should only be used in CSS and SVG.
### Unlike HTML, CSS will completely ignore unknown keywords.
### The color keywords all represent plain, solid colors, without transparency.
### Several keywords are aliases for each other:
- aqua / cyan
- fuchsia / magenta
- darkgray / darkgrey
- darkslategray / darkslategrey
- dimgray / dimgrey
- lightgray / lightgrey
- lightslategray / lightslategrey
- gray / grey
- slategray / slategrey
- Though many keywords have been adapted from X11, their RGB values may differ from the corresponding color on X11 systems since manufacturers sometimes tailor X11 colors to their specific hardware.
