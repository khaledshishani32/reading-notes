# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Assignment operators
### An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=),  which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is,
# x = y assigns the value of y to x.

# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Comparison operators

### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 
 ### examples :
 
 ## &nbsp; &nbsp;  var1 != 4
 ### &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 === var1
  # &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Methods 
  ## &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; alert() :
 ### &nbsp; &nbsp; The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.

 ###  An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

## &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  console.log() : 

### The console.log() method writes a message to the console.

### The console is useful for testing purposes.
