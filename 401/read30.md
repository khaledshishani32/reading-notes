#  Interview Advice and Tips 
---

### 1 ) First, Restate the Questio :
#### Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

### 2 ) Ask About Edge Cases : 
#### Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up.

### 3 ) Ask About Test Cases : 
#### This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary.

### 4 ) Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

#### You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later. 

### 5 ) Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good : 

#### You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. 


### 6 ) Stuck? Ask for Help! 

#### f you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. For example: “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?” 

#### The answer might be “no, I’d like to see if you can solve it from here on your own,” but it also very well might be a “yes” with a useful tip!
