## Simple Definition of Machine Learning
#### Machine Learning is an Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) it gives devices the ability to learn from their experiences and improve their self without doing any coding. For Example, when you shop from any website it’s shows related search like:- People who bought also saw this.

## What is Machine Learning?

#### Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is the study of making machines more human-like in their behaviour and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process. Good quality data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand, and the type of activity that needs to be automated.

## Why Should We Learn Machine Learning?

#### Machine Learning today has all the attention it needs. Machine Learning can automate many tasks, especially the ones that only humans can perform with their innate intelligence. Replicating this intelligence to machines can be achieved only with the help of machine learning. 

#### With the help of Machine Learning, businesses can automate routine tasks. It also helps in automating and quickly create models for data analysis. Various industries depend on vast quantities of data to optimize their operations and make intelligent decisions. Machine Learning helps in creating models that can process and analyze large amounts of complex data to deliver accurate results. These models are precise and scalable and function with less turnaround time. By building such precise Machine Learning models, businesses can leverage profitable opportunities and avoid unknown risks.

## Types of Machine Learning?
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
 


### Supervised Learning Algorithm
#### In Supervised learning, an AI system is presented with data which is labeled, which means that each data tagged with the correct label.
#### The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.

## Types of Supervised learning
- Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
- Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithm
#### In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI.

#### In the above example, we have given some characters to our model which are ‘Ducks’ and ‘Not Ducks’. In our training data, we don’t provide any label to the corresponding data. The unsupervised model is able to separate both the characters by looking at the type of data and models the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about it.
### Types of Unsupervised learning
- Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
- Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.
## Terminology of Machine Learning 

- Model: Also known as “hypothesis”, a machine learning model is the mathematical representation of a real-world process. A machine learning algorithm along with the training data builds a machine learning model.
Feature: A feature is a measurable property or parameter of the data-set.
- Feature Vector: It is a set of multiple numeric features. We use it as an input to the machine learning model for training and prediction purposes.
- Training: An algorithm takes a set of data known as “training data” as input. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the input data and trains the model for expected results (target). The output of the training process is the machine learning model.
- Prediction: Once the machine learning model is ready, it can be fed with input data to provide a predicted output.
Target (Label): The value that the machine learning model has to predict is called the target or label.
- Overfitting: When a massive amount of data trains a machine learning model, it tends to learn from the noise and inaccurate data entries. Here the model fails to characterise the data correctly.
- Underfitting: It is the scenario when the model fails to decipher the underlying trend in the input data. It destroys the accuracy of the machine learning model. In simple terms, the model or the algorithm does not fit the data well enough.
