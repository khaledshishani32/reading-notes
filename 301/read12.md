# Mongo and Mongoose

---

### 1) What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit

### 2) Give a real world example.
-   MySQL Community Edition

### 3) What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- If the project is expected to see drastic changes, needs to handle the huge and versatile amount of data, or the database entities and scheme is ambiguous at the start



    
 
### 4) Give a real world example.

- MongoDB






### 5) Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

-  NoSQL database




### 6) Which type of database is best for scalability?
- SQL database

---

### 1) What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language

### 2) What is a realational database?

- A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model

### 3) What is a ‘schema’?
- A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database. It can exist both as a visual representation and as a set of formulas known as integrity constraints that govern a database.
- 


### 4) What is a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL databases use a variety of data models for accessing and managing data. These types of databases are optimized specifically for applications that require large data volume, low latency, and flexible data models, which are achieved by relaxing some of the data consistency restrictions of other databases.


### 5) Howo does it work?
- are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.
 


### 6) What is inside of a Mongo database?
- MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.



### 7) 
- beacase NoSql Non-relational and utilize unstructured data to be able to store and process non-similar data sets that are associated with each other.

### 8) What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
