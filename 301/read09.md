# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

---

### 1) What is functional programming?
- Functional Programming is a programming paradigm where you mostly construct and structure your code using functions

### 2) What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, will always return the same output. Produces no side effects

### 3) What are the benefits of a pure function?
- Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs.



    
 
### 4) What is immutability?
- They reduce nasty bugs such as race conditions. Make it easier to debug and reason about our software. Becomes much simpler to write tests for our functions.






### 5)  What is Referential transparency?

-   programs is that they provide referential transparency. ... An interesting effect of referential transparency is that it makes your code context-independent, meaning that an expression can be run in any order or in any context and it will always return the same result.

### 1) What is a module?
- is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application. Each module in Node. js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.

 

 
### 2) What does the word ‘require’ do?
- The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules. So, if you want to load a local, relative JavaScript module into a Node. js application, you can simply use the require() method

### 3) How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- To include functions defined in another file in Node.js, we need to import the module.
