# State and Props 

### 1) What types of things can you pass in the props?
- you can pass a values exactly like when pass the values to proprties to consterctor function
  

### 2) What is the big difference between props and state? 
- Basically, the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters.  

 

### 3) When do we re-render our application?
- React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically.
    

### 4) What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- in state you can change and update the Behavior of what you want to change like if component of counter you can change from decreasing to increasing but on props you just render what you pass and the change like test.
