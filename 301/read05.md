# Putting it all together

### How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
- This can be done using dummy date we have to display in any markups that are then supplied, once we have the component hierarchy, we can build a static version in React.

### 2) What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
-  responsibility is either to render a list of items, or to show a date picker, or to make an HTTP request, or to draw a chart, or to lazy load an image

### 3) What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
- Static applications and websites render in the user’s browser without the need for server side processing, this means that all the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is done on the client side, rather then relying on server side technologies.
