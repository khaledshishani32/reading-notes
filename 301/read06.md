# NODE.JS
---

### What is node.js?
- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! .
- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
- A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.  


### 2) In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
-  Chrome V8 is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers.

### 3) What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

- Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests.

### 8)  What is node used for?

- Greater efficiency
-  Work environment readiness 


### 3) How does pair programming work? 
- Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in.
