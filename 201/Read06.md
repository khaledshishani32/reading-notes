# Object in javaScript
#### JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.

# Document Object Model
---

#### The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. In this guide, we'll briefly introduce the DOM. We'll look at how the DOM represents an HTML or XML document in memory and how you use APIs to create web content and applications.

#### In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually, they evolved into separate entities. The page content is stored in the DOM and may be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, so that we may write this approximative equation:
#### API = DOM + JavaScript .

# How use 
---
#### The document and window objects are the objects whose interfaces you generally use most often in DOM programming. In simple terms, the window object represents something like the browser, and the document object is the root of the document itself. Element inherits from the generic Node interface, and together these two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements. These elements may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data those elements hold, as in the table object example in the previous section.

#### The following is a brief list of common APIs in web and XML page scripting using the DOM.

- document.querySelector(selector)
- document.querySelectorAll(name)
- document.createElement(name)
- parentNode.appendChild(node)
- element.innerHTML
- element.style.left
- element.setAttribute()
- element.getAttribute()
- element.addEventListener()
- window.content
- GlobalEventHandlers/onload
- window.scrollTo()
