# JavaScript switch statements 
---

#### The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
#### Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

# how works
---
- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

### The switch statements do the same goal of if statements , But the switch statement is faster in most cases when compared to if-else , but significantly faster only when the number of conditions is large.
