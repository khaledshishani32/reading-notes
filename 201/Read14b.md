---

#### Put five, eight, 12 or more people together in a room, and it’s a crapshoot as to how well they’ll function as a team. The larger the group, the more difficult it becomes.

####  It’s a lot like dining out with a bunch of friends. Where to go? Italian? Vegetarian? Steakhouse? Each person has their own appetite, which can make creating a “shared-interest” extremely challenging.


# The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’
---
#### After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

## 1) Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
## 2) Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
## 3) Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
## 4) Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
## 5) Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.
