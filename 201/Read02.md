### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make it easier to understand JavaScript, let's think that you built a house out of wood and stones using HTML to give you the structure of the building, and in order to decorate and paint it in beautiful colors, you need CSS, and in order to extend the electricity to all the house rooms, for this you need JavaScript.

### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

### We can do a lot of things using Java like mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
### In addition to comparison operations such as greater than, smaller than, etc.

### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In order to be able to the operations that I mentioned, we need what he calls variables, and variables are a box in which the values that you want to perform certain arithmetic operations are placed on, and the variable is symbolized by var and this is the easiest way to define variables or values unlike other programming languages such as c++ and java .

### Example 

#### var myName="khaled";
#### console.log(myName);

#### out put in console 
#### khaled

#### The console.log() is the method to print the values at the console (the area where executes the code).
